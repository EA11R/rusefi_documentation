The short answer is yes.

The longer answer is also yes.  You need a wideband because a narrowband only tells you if you are RICH or LEAN, not HOW RICH or HOW LEAN.  How are you going to target 13:1 AFR at wide open throttle with a narrowband? Hint: it isn't possible.

PS: if you are looking to debate or double-check anything here - please don't. You _absolutely need_ wideband oxygen sensor.
