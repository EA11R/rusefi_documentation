# rusEFI Quick Start

Version 0.01

Congratulations, your fully assembled rusEFI unit has arrived! This document would get you started! Online version is available at https://rusefi.com/s/start

## Tuner Studio

We recommend that you use EFI Analytics Tuner Studio desktop application to tune your rusEFI Engine Control Unit.

As of February 2024 we recommend Tuner Studio BETA. Please download and install from https://www.efianalytics.com/TunerStudio/beta/ 

Lite edition would get the job done, but registered version comes with tons of benefits like search, higher logging rate etc etc.

## Create New Project

Hook up your rusEFI to your desktop with a cable. USB power is sufficient to get your unit running on your bench!

Launch Tuner Studio Beta and hit 'Create New Project'. Pick a name and hit 'Detect'.

Tuner Studio would scan through your connections and detect your unit! Hit 'Accept' in the bottom-right corner. Hit 'Next' a few times, hit 'Finish'. You are ready to calibrate your unit!
