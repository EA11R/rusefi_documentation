The weakest point of rusEFI is lack of samples and success stories. As of Aug 2020, we _really_ need vehicle threads on the forum. [HOWTO-contribute-success-stories](HOWTO-contribute-success-stories)

Another weak point of rusEFI is documentation. If you've played with rusEfi for any time chances are you have help improve the documentation.

We are also extremely short on software developers. [HOWTO-contribute-to-firmware](HOWTO-contribute-to-firmware)


## Please do good and do not do bad

We hope that as a community we can leverage each other's skills and have peaceful fun together.

We probably would not articulate the guiding principles better than https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/blob/master/docs/development/Development.md and https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md

#### Last but not least

Since 2012 until today, this is just a hobby project with zero paid employees. Test PCBs, forum hosting, damaged hardware and etc. costs money

There are two ways to help financially: 

One-time or monthly https://tinyurl.com/paypal-rusefi
