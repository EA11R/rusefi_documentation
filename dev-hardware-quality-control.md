Between chip shortage, quick prototyping pace and choice of semi-manual assembly we have less than 100% quality.

As of July 9th we have custom FW builds and custom LED board with custom undocumented wired pigtail. Humans are to program, initiate test and evaluate LED status.

We need a solution to speed up the complete programming and validation cycle of freshly assembled boards.
