(do we have this somewhere already?)

We have too many channels.
* forum
* wiki
* facebook
* slack
* source code on github

We do not pay for Slack history - Slack history is purged.

Universal long term car knowledge? probably wiki

I have a cool project, it's my own not universal knowledge? at least a summary on the forum

I need help? Please start on the forum, please go to slack after first back and forth, please post summary on the forum.
