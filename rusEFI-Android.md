rusEFI Android App is part of [rusEFI Online](https://github.com/rusefi/rusefi/wiki/Online) suite. The primary job of rusEFI Android app is to provide rusEFI ECU with remote tuning capability.

One day we will publish rusEFI Android at the google store but for now you would have to install it using [rusEFI-release.apk](https://rusefi.com/build_server/rusEFI-release.apk)
