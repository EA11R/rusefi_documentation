rusEFI [_firmware_](https://github.com/rusefi/rusefi) is completely open source software.

Many of the **universal** rusEFI [boards](Hardware) are open source hardware.

As of May of 2021 rusEFI LLC is experimenting with vehicle-specific boards being proprietary, not open source hardware. Most of microRusEFI _adapter_ boards for specific vehicles are not open source. While [Hellen One framework](https://github.com/andreika-git/hellen-one) is open source, only [Hellen 121 VAG](https://github.com/rusefi/hellen121vag) reference vehicle specific board is open source. For the majority of Hellen vehicle specific boards we only publish complete schematics while not publishing gerbers and BOMs.
