What vehicle if any is a good candidate for next Hellen board?

Arguments for:
- cheap enthusiast platform like non-M3 e46
- wide ECU reuse between different vehicles (Nissan 121 for instance)
- [test mules in rusEFI community](https://github.com/andreika-git/hellen-boards/blob/master/commercial_products/evil_thoughts.md)

Arguments against:
- expensive platform like e46 M3
- good tuneability in OEM form
- overall CAN and/or other data bus complexity



# Vote with dollars proposal

Maybe not attempt to decide based on _expert opinion_ but use dollar metric?

Ask FB rusEFI group members to post paypal deposits with platform votes. Winning total dollar amount moves forward, all other deposits are refunded. Participants get ECUs at fixed $300 price once fabricated.

todo: better articulate ^^^ idea in more understandable terms?
