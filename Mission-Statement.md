We are so serious we even have a Mission Statement!

rusEFI is a group of enthusiasts developing a fundamentally _smarter_ open source ECU. As of 2021, we have built an amazing foundation but there are still too many loose ends for end users to run an engine successfully without keeping close tabs on development.  Current hardware and software offerings aim to cater to those interested in further development.  In fact, the level of active development currently makes rusEFI primarily a tinkering platform not a engine management product.
