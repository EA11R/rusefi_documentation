# 2021 is the year of Hellen

By the way, Hellen is the son of Deucalion (we have Deucalion board). Deucalion is the son of Prometheus (we have Prometheus board).

Mary Shelley has a novel named "Frankenstein, or The Modern Prometheus" and that's how Hellen name has roots in Frankenstein which was the first rusEFI board :)
