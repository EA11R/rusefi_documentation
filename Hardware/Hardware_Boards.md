Q: How to select a board?

A: History shows that fully assembled boards are the safest way to start. History shows
that 80% of the kits are never assembled. As of March 2020 we have many assembled microRusEfi and
very remaining old stock assembled Frankenso. New fabrication of assembled Frankenso is
currently not planned.

Q: What else matters?

A: Types and total count of crank and camshaft positions sensors is the next
important question. microRusEfi unfortunately only supports one VR shaft input maximum with two inputs total. 

Frankenso supports up to 2 VR or 2 Hall shaft position sensors. Prometheus supports TBD. Proteus supports TBD.
