## HOWTO microRusEfi Kit


[mircoRusEfi kit](https://www.ebay.com/itm/333517397424) comes 75% assembled - while many components are already mounted, about two dozens
still need to be added. This includes both easy to mount components like main connector and harder to solder
TLE8888 100-pin chip. Some soldering hints and tricks [are discussed here](https://rusefi.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=425).
If in double of your SMD skills please consider fully assembled version. 


For component placement [please use interactive BOM](https://rusefi.com/docs/ibom/microRusEfi_R0.4.7.html).


Depending on your crankshaft position sensor type you would need to populate either Hall or VR option.

For Hall, you would need to REMOVE (TDB)


All microRusEfi kits use [MRE F4 rusEfi firmware - DOWNLOAD LATEST BUNDLE HERE](https://rusefi.com/build_server/rusefi_bundle_mre-f4.zip)
