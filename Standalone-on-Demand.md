# Plug In, not Plug and Play

* Uses OEM header (new if available, used otherwise)
* Goes into OEM case
* Basic CAN programming included according to provided CAN message format
* Tuning NOT included
* K-line NOT supported
* Vehicle integration research NOT included
* TL,DR: this is a _blank_ plug-in _board_ not a "Hook it up and drive to the race track" deal. While we can produce a great ECU, only someone with a test vehicle can make the base tune. Please do your research!

# What next?

rusEFI LLC does not have experience and resources to provide adequate support to retail customers. The ideal setup is rusEFI focusing on hardware, software and fabrication, with _product owners_ dealing with sales, marketing and user support for each of the platform specific ECUs.

FAQ:

## Q: What do you mean not PnP?

A: We cannot guarantee a turn key product without a test mule at our disposal in NJ, USA.

## Q: I want a turn key solution?

A: We have not done that yet, that would be more money :( Step one would be to have a test mule purchased in NJ, USA. Rougthly please expect test mule cost and $11K on top of that, and that's just a wild guess - we have no tried that yet, some modern vehicle with too much CAN would be more for sure.

## Q: Do I get all fabrication files?

A: Yes, you get all files for full control to change or fabricate additional boards independently.
