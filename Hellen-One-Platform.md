Hellen One Platform is a new take on a modular approach for rusEFI ECU - both universal and plug-and-play.
A number of functional building modules were developed with the intention of easily combining those depending on the specific PCB use case, by simply interconnecting them by merging a number of reusable modules on a single PCB. Hellen One framework merges modules so that we do not have to sandwich separate PCBs.
