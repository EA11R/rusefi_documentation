# Notes on fully custom M111 Engine Harness

## Reference point

While harness design is work in progress we use reference point R. R is currently 100cm from ECU.

R+5 would mean "5cm further away from ECU from point R", "R-5" would mean "5cm closer to ECU"

## Low current subassembly

x4 sensor gnd crimp, R+40cm
x3 sensor +5v crimp, R+40cm
